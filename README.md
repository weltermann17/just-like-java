just-like-java. 

A library to add cool Java stuff to the C++ world.


Initial commit. Lot's of things still need to be done:

- port of build routines to more common ones for msvc, gcc and more
- adding the cppdoc
- adding a license, currently please use "as-is"

This library was build to make large C++ projects easier and more productive. It was based on the 1.6 Java version.

More to come.
