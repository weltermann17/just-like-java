A library to add cool Java stuff to the C++ world.


Initial commit. Lots of things still need to be done:

- port of build routines to more common ones for msvc, gcc and more
- adding the cppdoc
- adding a license, currently please use "as-is"
- list in detail all 3rd party dependencies (ptypes, zlib, xerces etc.) 
- show use cases and provide examples
- modularization explained

This library was build to make large C++ projects easier and more productive. It was based at that time on the 1.6 Java version. 

To get started first have a look at all the headers in 'PublicInterfaces'. It gives you an overview of what is available.

Some sample code:

More to comme.
